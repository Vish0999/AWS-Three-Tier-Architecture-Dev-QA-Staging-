Three-Tier Architecture (Dev, QA, Staging)
                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Let's create a complete Terraform project to deploy a three-tier architecture with environments for dev, qa, and staging. This example covers most Terraform concepts, including variables, modules, outputs, remote state, and provisioners.


Key Highlights of the Project: 

    1) Multi-environment setup with isolated configurations for Dev, QA, and Staging.
    2) Modular approach for easy reuse and scalability.
    3) Secure state management with S3, DynamoDB locking, and encryption using KMS.
    4) Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform with automated EC2, VPC, and RDS setups.

Modules Overview:

      • VPC Module: Creates a secure VPC with public subnets.
      • EC2 Module: Deploys scalable web servers using EC2 instances.
      • RDS Module: Sets up a secure MySQL database instance.
      
 Ensuring Security for Terraform State:
     • Remote state stored securely in AWS S3 with versioning and encryption.
     • State locking using DynamoDB to prevent concurrent modifications.
     • Encrypted state files with AWS KMS.
     • Restricted access via IAM policies.
